# Get Started with OpenVINOâ„¢ Deep Learning Workbench and Samples for Linux*

For an overview and details about OpenVINO, see the [OpenVINO Overview](OpenVINO_Overview.md)

Please refer to the above guide as needed.   

<br>

NOTE: When using OpenVINO from the command line, you must setup your environment whenever you change users or launch a new terminal.
    `source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh`

## <a name="Exercises"></a> Exercises

The following series of exercises guide you through using samples of increasing complexity. As you move through each exercise you will get a sense of how to use OpenVINO in more sophisticated use cases. 

**NOTE:** Before starting these sample exercises, change directories into the samples directory:

`cd ~/omz_demos_build/intel64/Release`

**NOTE:** During this exercise you will be asked to move to multiple different directories, and occasionally to copy files (so that you don't have to specify full paths in commands).  You are welcome to set up environment variables to make these tasks easier, but we leave that to you.

   <summary>Exercise 1 - Run A Sample Application</summary>
    
### <a name="run-sample-application"></a> Exercise 1 - Run A Sample Application 

Convert a model using the Model Optmizer then use a sample application to load the model and run inference.


**Set Up a Neural Network Model**

In this section, you will convert an FP32 model suitable for running on a CPU.

Note: Remember to setup the environment variables when logging in, changing users, or launching a new terminal.
    `source /opt/intel/openvino/bin/setupvars.sh` 

1.	Make a directory for the FP32 SqueezeNet Model:

    `mkdir ~/squeezenet1.1_FP32`

2.	Go to ~/squeezenet1.1_FP32:

    `cd ~/squeezenet1.1_FP32`

3.	Use the Model Optimizer to convert an FP32 SqueezeNet Caffe model into an optimized Intermediate Representation (IR):

    `python3 /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/mo.py --input_model ~/Desktop/Data/models/Caffe/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.caffemodel --data_type FP32 --output_dir .`    

4.	The `squeezenet1.1.labels` file contains the classes that ImageNet uses. This file is included so that the inference results show text instead of classification numbers. Copy `squeezenet1.1.labels` to your optimized model location:

    `cp ~/openvino_models/ir/public/squeezenet1.1/FP16/squeezenet1.1.labels .`

5.	Copy a sample image to the release directory. You will use this with your optimized model:

    `sudo cp /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/demo/car.png  .`

6. Once your setup is complete, you're ready to run a sample application:

    `cd  ~/inference_engine_samples_build/intel64/Release`

    `./classification_sample_async -i car.png -m ~/squeezenet1.1_FP32/squeezenet1.1.xml -d CPU`

7. Note: you can usually see an applications help information (parameters, etc.) by using `-h`.

    `./classification_sample -h`

   <summary>Exercise 2 - Using the DL Workbench</summary>
    
### <a name="run-sample-application"></a> Exercise 2 - Run A Sample Application with the DL Workbench

Convert a model using the DL Workbench, then use a sample application to load the model and run inference.

**NOTE:** If you are running inference only on a CPU, you already have the required FP32 model. If you want to run inference on any hardware other than the CPU, you'll need an FP16 version of the model.

**Set Up a Neural Network Model**

In this section, you will convert an FP32 model suitable for running on a CPU.

1.	Return to the previously indicated FP32 SqueezeNet directory:

    `cd ~/squeezenet1.1_FP32`

2.	Use the DL Workbench to convert the FP32 SqueezeNet Caffe model into an FP16 optimized Intermediate Representation (IR):
/home/vino/Desktop/Data/models/Caffe/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.caffemodel
    1. In a web browser, launch the DL Workbench:
    `http://127.0.0.1:5665/`
    2. Select "Get Started" to show the setup interface.
    3. The setup interface is divided into two sections.
        - The top section is for loading models.
        - The bottom section is for loading data sets (for example, images that will be used by the model during inference).
     4. Select the "Original Model" tab - the default tab is for downloading models from the OpenVINO Model Zoo.
     5. Select Framework -> "Caffe"
     6. Choose the prototxt file with the first "Choose File" button.
        - ~/Desktop/Data/models/Caffe/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.protoxt
     7. Choose the caffemodel file with the second "Choose File" button.
        - ~/Desktop/Data/models/Caffe/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.caffemodel
     8. The Model Name will be automatically populated, but change it if desired.  
        - This can be useful when tracking multiple loaded models
     9. Select "Import Model" when ready.  
        - This will create and FP16 model by default, though configuration settings may be edited later.
    10. In some cases this will work and you will be returned to the setup interface.  If the DL Workbench is unable to determine required information, it will display a configuration screen and specify information that is required.
        - If you built the model, you will know all of the details of the model, but you may have to do some searching if the model was downloaded from a third party.
     11. The "Import Model" screen is being displayed, because some additional information must be provided by the user.
     12. The requirements are specified in the grey box on the right.
     13. In this, the only missing information is the colorspace.  Click on the box next to "Original Color Space" and select "BGR".
         - BGR is often used (as opposed to RGB and other color formats) when training models.
     14. Note that the grey box no longer contains any red warning text.
     15. Select "Convert" and you will be returned to the setup interface.  Model conversion may take several minutes.

3. Import a Dataset into the DL Workbench
    1. We could autogenerate a set of simuluated images, but for this task we'll select a subset of the ImageNet dataset.
        - Note: results will often be better using real images.
    2. Select "Import Local Dataset"
    3. Select "Choose File" and browse to "~/Desktop/Workbench/Data/Imagenet_200_224x224.zip"
    4. Select "Import Dataset"
        - Note: The height and width of images in the dataset must satisfy the requirements of the target model.
        
4. Run Inference with the DL Workbench
    1. Select the model from the top part of the interface.
    2. Select the dataset from the bottom part of the interface.
    3. Select the Environment (target hardware).
    4. All items in the status box next to the Environment box should now have green checks.
    5. Select 'Go'
        - This will take a few minutes

5. Normally, we would encourage analysis and optimization of the model, but for this exercise, we'll just export the model from the Workbench to our system.  
    1. Take a few minutes to look at the output if desired.
    2. When ready, find the download icon at the right, in the top squeezenet model bar.
    3. Select Download.  This will drop a tar.gz archive in your default downloads directly (~/Downloads).
    4. `cd ~/Downloads`
    5. `mkdir squeezenet`
    6.  `mv squeeze*gz squeezenet`
    7. `cd squeezenet`
    8. `tar zxvf squeezenet1.1.tar.gz`

6.	The `squeezenet1.1.labels` file contains the classes that ImageNet uses. This file is included so that the inference results show text as well as classification percentages. Copy `squeezenet1.1.labels` to your optimized model location:

    `cp ~/openvino_models/ir/public/squeezenet1.1/FP16/squeezenet1.1.labels .`

7.	Copy a sample image to the release directory. You will use this with your optimized model:

    `cd  ~/inference_engine_samples_build/intel64/Release`

    `sudo cp /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/demo/car.png  .`

8. Once your setup is complete, you're ready to run a sample application:

    `./classification_sample_async -i car.png -m ~/Downloads/squeezenet1.1/squeezenet1.1.xml -d CPU`

9. Note: you can usually see an applications help information (parameters, etc.) by using `-h`.

    `./classification_sample_async -h`

   <summary>Exercise 3 - Vehicle Detection on CPU with FP32</summary>
    
    
### Exercise 3: Vehicle Detection on CPU

***Step 1 - Setup the Model***

    1. In the Workbench GUI, Select "Import Model"
    2. Select vehicle-detection-adas-0002 (FP32)
    3. Select Import
    4. Note: If there are problems downloading, try the alternate method below.

Alternate Method:

    1.  In the DLW Web GUI (web browser):
        - Select Import Model -> Original Model
    2. Select Choose File:
        - ~/Desktop/Data/Models/Intel/FP32/vehicle-detection-adas-0002.xml
    3. Select the Second Choose File Button:
         - ~/Desktop/Data/Models/Intel/FP32/vehicle-detection-adas-0002.bin 
    4. Select Import

***Step 2 - Import Dataset***

    1. Select Import Local Dataset -> Choose File
    2. Select: ~/Desktop/Data/datasets/VOC7_248.zip
    3. Select Import Dataset

***Step 3 - Select Environment***
    1. Select CPU
   
***Step 4 - Download the Model***
Find the download icon in the top right bar of the DL Workbench (next to the trash can).  This will download the model to the default directory: ~/Downloads, as a tar.gz file.  We'll move this file in the next step for convenience.
   
***Step 5 - Additional Setup for Ease of Use***

We'll create a set of directories to store our models, and separate them by their format.  

Remember:
FP32 is for CPU (CPU can run FP16, but it will be slower).  GPU can run FP32 models but it will be sub-optimal.
FP16 is for all hardware except CPU.
INT8 is for CPU.  Some models will be very fast in the INT8 format.

NOTE:  FPGA may support FP11 in some cases through bitstreams.  This will usually be the fastest option for FPGA, and conversion is automatically handled with FP16 models.

    1. mkdir ~/ir
    2. mkdir ~/ir/FP32
    3. mkdir ~/ir/FP16
    4. mkdir ~/ir/INT8

Now we move some files around to make running the samples a little easier.

    1. cp ~/Downloads/vehicle-detection-adas-* ~/ir/FP32
    2. cd ~/ir/FP32
    3. mv ~/Downloads/vehicle-detection-adas-*tar.gz .
    4. tar zxvf vehicle-detection-adas-0002.tar.gz
    5. rm vehicle*tar.gz
    6. cd ~/omz_demos_build/intel64/Release

And we're ready to execute the sample:

    `./security_barrier_camera_demo -i ~/Videos/cars_hwy.mp4 -m ~/ir/FP32/vehicle-detection-adas-0002.xml -d CPU`

    7. You should have been returned to the main screen.  Press the Execute button.

    8. Download the model.
   
***Step 6 - Additional Setup for Ease of Use***

Now we move some files to make running the samples a little easier.
NOTE:  The unzipped int8 bin and xml files are dynamically generated and may not exactly match the names listed below (11_int8.xml).  Make sure to substitute the correct xml name.

    1. mv ~/Downloads/"vehicle-detection-adas-0002_- Int 8.tar.gz" ~/ir/INT8
    2. cd ~/ir/INT8
    3. tar zxvf vehicle-detection-adas-0002*.tar.gz
    4. rm vehicle*tar.gz
    5. cd ~/omz_demos_build/intel64/Release

And we're ready to execute the sample:

    ./security_barrier_camera_demo -i ~/Videos/cars_hwy.mp4 -m ~/ir/INT8/11_int8.xml -d CPU

***Step 7 - Compare and Evaluate Performance

Take a few minutes to compare the performance of the INT8 and FP32 models.  Feel free to explore options in the DL Workbench, and experiment with changes if desired.
